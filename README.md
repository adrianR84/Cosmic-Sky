## ‚öôÔ∏è Controls & Customization

### Interactive Controls
- **Star Movement Speed** - Adjust how quickly stars move (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Star Count** - Set the number of stars (100-4000)
- **Trail Fade Speed** - Adjust how quickly star trails disappear (0.01-0.3)

- **Star Frequency** - Adjust time between shooting stars (0.1-1.0 seconds)

### Configuration Persistence
All your customization settings are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This means:
- Your preferred settings will be remembered between sessions
- The visualization will start with your last used configuration
- No need to reconfigure the settings each time you visit

To reset to default settings, you can either:
1. Click the "Clear" button in the control panel (if enabled)
2. Clear your browser's local storage for this site, or
3. Use the browser's developer tools to remove the 'cosmicGalaxyConfig' item from local storage

### Feature Flags
You can enable/disable features by modifying the `FEATURES` object in `js/config/defaults.js`:

```javascript
export const FEATURES = {
    CLEAR_LOCAL_STORAGE: true,    // Show clear local storage button
};
```

### Advanced Customization
You can further customize the visualization by modifying these values in the code. These changes will be saved automatically:

- **Star Count**: `CONFIG.starCount` in `main.js`
- **Connection Distance**: `CONFIG.connectionDistance` in `main.js`
- **Color Scheme**: `CONFIG.colors` in `main.js`
- **Star Appearance**: `Star` class in `js/star.js`
- **Animation Parameters**: `Starfield` class in `js/starfield.js`

### Example: Changing Star Colors
```javascript
// In main.js
CONFIG.colors = {
  starHueMin: 180,    // Blue-cyan
  starHueMax: 300,    // Purple
  starSaturation: 80, // 0-100
  starLightness: 80   // 0-100
};
```
